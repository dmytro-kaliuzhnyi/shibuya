# shibuya — runbook

Raspberry Pi 5, Ubuntu 24.04 arm64. A working server I reach from my phone over mosh.

## How to connect

| From | Command |
|---|---|
| Mac, at home | `mosh -p 60000:60010 koinoyokan171@shibuya.local` |
| Mac, over Tailscale | `mosh -p 60000:60010 koinoyokan171@shibuya` |
| iPhone (Blink) | profile `shibuya` — Tailscale name, mosh, ports `60000:60010` |
| iPhone, fallback | profile `shibuya-wan` — public IP at my parents' place, forwarded TCP port |

Logging in drops you straight into the tmux session `main`, so work survives a dropped
connection, a phone reboot and a dead battery. The tmux prefix is `C-a`, mouse mode is on
(tap switches pane, swipe scrolls back through history).

## Deploying and making changes

Everything is configured by idempotent scripts. There is no need to touch the system by
hand — edit a script and deploy, and the configuration stays reproducible (moving to an
SSD then comes down to a single run).

```bash
# from the Mac
cd ~/shibuya
./deploy.sh                      # sync only
./deploy.sh --run                # sync and run phase A
./deploy.sh --run --only 20      # a single script
./bootstrap.sh --list            # see what exists

# on the Pi
~/shibuya/verify.sh              # acceptance check
```

Re-running is safe: a script does nothing if the state is already in place. Originals of
every system file touched are kept in `/etc/shibuya/backups/`.

## If access is lost

Cheapest first.

1. **Check which channel is alive.** Tailscale and port forwarding are independent:
   ```bash
   tailscale status              # from the Mac
   nc -vz <public IP> <port>     # port forward
   ```
2. **Did the public IP change?** A Telegram notification is sent when it does. After that
   the forward on my parents' router points nowhere — it needs the new IP, or DDNS.
3. **Tailscale dropped.** Usually an expired node key. Check the
   [admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines); key expiry for `shibuya`
   should be **disabled**.
4. **The machine does not answer at all.** Self-healing (`shibuya-netcheck.timer`) restarts
   networking after 15 minutes without connectivity and reboots the machine after 30. If the
   internet is still gone, further reboots come only after 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, then every 12h
   (`81-netcheck.sh`): during a power cut the router is dead and rebooting does not help.
   The watchdog reboots on a kernel hang. So waiting ~30 minutes is a deliberate strategy,
   not doing nothing.
5. **Nothing helped** — call my parents: "pull the power out of the little box, wait ten
   seconds, plug it back in."

### Locked myself out with the firewall

When ufw is enabled the script arms a 10-minute auto-rollback timer. If the connection
drops right after enabling it, just wait — ufw turns itself off. Cancel it by hand once
you have confirmed connectivity:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop shibuya-ufw-rollback.timer
```

### Broke sshd

`20-hardening.sh` validates the config with `sshd -t` before reloading and rolls the
drop-in back if validation fails. It does a `reload`, not a `restart` — existing sessions
survive. If it is broken anyway: get in over Tailscale (a separate channel) and restore
the file from `/etc/shibuya/backups/`.

## If the machine is compromised

Written up front so there is nothing to figure out in the moment. The order matters — cut
access first, investigate afterwards.

```bash
# 1. Remove the machine from the tailnet (from any other device)
#    admin console -> Machines -> shibuya -> Remove

# 2. Revoke cloud credentials
gcloud auth revoke --all
#    + GCP Console -> IAM -> service accounts / user sessions

# 3. Delete the Pi's SSH keys from GitHub
gh ssh-key list        # find 'shibuya-pi (skelar)' and 'shibuya-pi (personal)'
gh ssh-key delete <id>

# 4. Revoke the Claude Code token
#    claude.ai -> Settings -> rotate

# 5. Remove the port forward on my parents' router
```

The keys on the Pi are deliberately **separate** from the Mac's keys — the work laptop is
untouched and rotation stays scoped to one machine.

## Things to know about this machine

- **It boots from an SD card.** A consumable: it degrades with writes and goes read-only
  after a year or two. Logs are capped at 200 MB, swap lives in zram (in RAM) and `noatime`
  is on — but moving to a USB SSD is still a matter of time.
- **Automatic reboot at 04:00** if kernel security updates have landed. tmux sessions die
  with it. That is a deliberate trade: an unpatched kernel on a machine exposed to the
  internet is worse than a lost session, and a regular reboot also proves the machine can
  still boot — while that is still fixable by hand.
- **The `docker` group is equivalent to root.** On a single-user machine that is a
  conscious trade for convenience.
- **The client-context key `pt` is deliberately not on this machine.** If it is ever
  needed: `sudo SHIBUYA_WITH_PT=1 ~/shibuya/bootstrap.sh --only 70`.
